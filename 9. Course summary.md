<h1>9. Course summary</h1>
<p>Congratulations. You reach the end of this course. However, most of the time, it is easier said than done. So try to do more hands on experiments and practise what you have learnt in this course.</p>
<p>Here's a simple summary of what we have gone through.</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>Basic concepts including variables, conditions, loops, functions and input / output (I/O). These concepts apply to most modern languages, not only in R.</p>

<h2>Core</h2>
<p>The core of this course is data types and data structures. How to create them, modified them and index them is the key to successful problem solving.</p>

<h2>Expansion</h2>
<p>Then comes the expansions of concepts of variables, conditions, loops, functions and I/O. This part shows you how R implements these concepts.</p>

<h2>Advanced topics</h2>
<p>This includes graphics in R and object-oriented programming (OOP). Knowing these might not help much at the begining, but will definitely teach you how to think differently.</p>
