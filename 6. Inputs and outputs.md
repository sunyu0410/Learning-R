<h1>Inputs and outputs</h1>

<h2>Capture from keyboard</h2>
```r
# Use readline() function to read keyboard inputs
a = readline("Please enter a number: ")
print(a)
# To use a as a numebr
a = as.numeric(a)
```

<h2>Working with text files</h2>
There are different functions to read from a table-like text file: <code>read.csv</code>, <code>read.csv2</code>, <code>read.delim</code>, <code>read.delim2</code>. They all call the <code>read.table</code> function with different arguments in the end.
```r
# You can read local files or a URL.
# Read the stock data from Yahoo
stock = read.csv("http://real-chart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=CSV&d=2&e=15&f=2016&g=d&a=7&b=9&c=1996&ignore=.csv")
# Save the file
write.csv(stock, '~/Desktop/stock.csv', row.names=F)
# Now you can read the file again as a local file.
#  This time read the header as a row.
stock2 = read.csv('~/Desktop/stock.csv', header=FALSE)
```

<h2>Working with images</h2>
<code>R</code> has quite a few packages for working with images. It also has built-in functions to save plots.
```r
library(png)
img = readPNG('~/Desktop/image.png')
dim(img)

img[,,2] = 30
# Save the image
savePNG(img, '~/Desktop/image2.png')

# Save plots
randomData = runif(100)
# Plot the histogrom using hist() without saving the plot
hist(randomData)

# Here's how you save the plot as a PNG image
png('~/Desktop/hist.png', width=800, height=600)
hist(randomData)
dev.off()

# or as a PDF file
pdf('~/Desktop/hist.pdf')
hist(randomData)
dev.off()
```

<h2>Redirect the screen output</h2>
Use <code>sink()</code> to redirect screen output to a text file.
```r
# Without redirecting, things should be printed on screen
print('Hello world')

# Redirecting outputs
sink('~/Desktop/output.txt')
print('Hello world')
sink()
```
Sometimes you want to let your script run so that you can do other things.
```batch
:: Run input.r and store every output in output.txt
R CMD BATCH input.r output.txt &
```

<h2>Homework</h2>
<ol>Accomplish the following tasks.
  <li>Create 50 random numbers using <code>runif()</code> and assign it to <code>x</code>;</li>
  <li>Create 50 random numbers using <code>runif()</code> and assign it to <code>y</code>;</li>
  <li>Try <code>plot(x,y)</code> and guess what it does;</li>
  <li>Save the plot as a PDF;</li>
  <li>Plot the histogram of y and save it as a PNG image;</li>
</ol>
