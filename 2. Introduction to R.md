<h1>Introduction to R</h1>

<h2>Why R?</h2>
<p>There are many popular programming languages nowdays. For example, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java and C++ are common languages of choice. But why R?</p>
<p>Personally, I found R very powerful in manupulating tabular data and machine learning. It has a large collection of high quality libraries, which is sufficient for most of you work. So what you need to do is to learn the basics syntax and know how to use a library you choose.</p>

<h2>Single Variables</h2>

```r
# To create a numeric variable
a = 10

# You can also use arrows for assignment
# Left arrow
a <- 20
# Right arrow
30 -> a

# Notice you can change the value of a variable


# print() will have a line break
print(a)

# cat() doesn't include the line break
cat(a)

# Create 2 more numeric variables by yourself

# To see what variables are available
objects()
# Or use ls()
ls()


```

<h2>Vector</h2>
<p>1-D array of elements</p>

```r
# Use c() to create a vector
v = c(1, 2, 3)
print(v)

# Indexing a vector
# Index starts from 1
print(v[1])
print(v[2])
print(v[-3])
print(v[1:2])

# Reassignment
v[2] = 10

# Get the length of a vector
length(v)

# Use seq() to create a vector
s = seq(from=0, to=10, by=0.5)

# This creates a vector from 0 to 10
# with increment of 0.5
```

<h2>Matrix</h2>
<p>2-D arrays of elements</p>

```r
# Use matrix() to create a vector
# Pay attention how the matrix is filled
m = matrix(1:10, nrow=5)
print(m)

# To change the order of fills
m2 = matrix(1:10, nrow=5, byrow=T)

# Transpose using t()
m3 = t(m2)

# Get the dimension of a matrix
dim(m)

# Indexing a matrix
m[1:2, 1:2]
m[4]


```

<h2>List</h2>
<p>A contrainer for key-value pairs</p>

```r
# Use list() to create a list
l = list(x=1, y=2)

# To retrieve a item based on key
l[['x']]
l[['y']]

# Or use $
l$x
l$y

# To see what colomns are in the list
names(l)

# Most things in R can be reassigned
names(l) = c('First', 'Second')
print(l)
```

<h2>Data Frame</h2>
<p>Tables in command line</p>

```r
# Use data.frame() to create a data frame
df = data.frame(x=1:10, y=11:20)
print(df)

# Data frame is a very flexible data types in R
# It makes it much easier to manipulate your data

# Indexing
df[3:4, 'x']
df[4:8, 'y']
df[, c('x','y')]

# Indexing by conditions
df[df>5]
df[df$x>10, 'y']

# Try to get the conlumn names and dimensions by yourself
```

<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>Create a data frame as following.</p>
<pre>
 foo bar baz
  10 5.0   1
  12 5.5   2
  14 6.0   3
  16 6.5   4
  18 7.0   5
  20 7.5   6
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Get the dimension</li>
  <li>Get the column names</li>
  <li>Select the 2nd to 4th row;</li>
  <li>Change 6.0 at colomn baz to 60;</li>
  <li>Select the rows where foo>14 and column baz;</li>
</ul>
