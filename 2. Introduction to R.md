<h1>Introduction to R</h1>

<h2>Why R?</h2>
<p>There are many popular programming languages nowdays. For example, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java and C++ are common languages of choice. But why R?</p>
<p>Personally, I found R very powerful in manupulating tabular data and machine learning. It has a large collection of high quality libraries, which is sufficient for most of you work. So what you need to do is to learn the basics syntax and know how to use a library you choose.</p>

<h2>Single Variables</h2>

```r
# To create a numeric variable
a = 10

# You can also use arrows for assignment
# Left arrow
a <- 20
# Right arrow
30 -> a

# Notice you can change the value of a variable


# print() will have a line break
print(a)

# cat() doesn't include the line break
cat(a)

# Create 2 more numeric variables by yourself

# To see what variables are available
objects()
# Or use ls()
ls()


```

<h2>Vectors</h2>
<p>1-D array of elements</p>

```r
# Use c() to create a vector
v = c(1, 2, 3)
print(v)

# Indexing a vector
# Index starts from 1
print(v[1])
print(v[2])
print(v[-3])
print(v[1:2])

# Reassignment
v[2] = 10

# Get the length of a vector
length(v)
```

<h2>Matrices</h2>
<p>2-D arrays of elements</p>

```r
# Use matrix() to create a vector
# Pay attention how the matrix is filled
m = matrix(1:10, nrow=5)
print(m)

# To change the order of fills
m2 = matrix(1:10, nrow=5, byrow=T)

# Transpose using t()
m3 = t(m2)

# Get the dimension of a matrix
dim(m)

# Indexing a matrix
m[1:2, 1:2]
m[4]


```
