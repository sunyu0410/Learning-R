<h1>Concepts in modern programming (part II)</h1>
<h2>Object-oriented programming</h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way towards computer problem solving. It treats entities in programs as objects in daily life. It is a programming paradign and is supported by most modern languages, including R.</p>

<h2>Class</h2>
<p>The concept of object is always hand in hand with the concept of a class. Class is the blue print of an object. An object, on the other hand, is an instatiation of a class. You can define the class (blue print) once and use it to make multiple objects (say, build more than one houses).</p>

<h2>Attribute and behavior</h2>
<p>Most objects in daily life has attributes attached to them. For a bank account, it has account name, account number, valid period and balance. For a book, it has title, author, price and word count. These attributes are some information associated with the object which we find useful in problem solving. Attributes are just variables associated with objects.</p>
<p>Similarly, most objects also have behavior. A person can walk and speak, a vehicle can move, a gun can fire, etc. Behaviors performs some tasks related to the object. They are functions associated with objects.</p>
