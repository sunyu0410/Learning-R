<h1>Concepts in modern programming (part II)</h1>
<h2>Object-oriented programming</h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way towards computer problem solving. It treats entities in programs as objects in daily life. It is a programming paradign and is supported by most modern languages, including R.</p>

<h2>Class</h2>
<p>The concept of object is always hand in hand with the concept of a class. Class is the blue print of an object. An object, on the other hand, is an instatiation of a class. You can define the class (blue print) once and use it to make multiple objects (say, build more than one houses).</p>

<h2>Attribute and behavior</h2>
<p>Most objects in daily life has attributes attached to them. For a bank account, it has account name, account number, valid period and balance. For a book, it has title, author, price and word count. These attributes are some information associated with the object which we find useful in problem solving. Attributes are just variables associated with objects.</p>
<p>Similarly, most objects also have behavior. A person can walk and speak, a vehicle can move, a gun can fire, etc. Behaviors performs some tasks related to the object. They are functions associated with objects.</p>

<h2>What's special about OOP?</h2>
<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<p>The process to extract a "class" requires certain types of abstraction. Sometimes the level of such abstraction could be very high, especially when the class itself is not touchable, e.g. relationships between the boss and employees.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>Sometimes one class can fall into the category of another class. For example, we have a class named <code>human</code> which has some attributes (name, gender, age) and behaviours (eat, sleep, walk). Now we have another class <code>teacher</code>. Assuming all teachers are humans, we should expect the <code>teacher</code> class has at least the minimal attributes and behaviours from the <code>human</code> class. Instead of defining the <code>teacher</code> class from ground up, <code>teacher</code> can <b>inherit</b> from <code>human</code>. Hence we say <code>teacher</code> is a <b>subclass</b> of <code>human</code> and <code>human</code> is the <b>superclass</b> of <code>teacher</code>. Such <b>inheritance</b> is supported by most modern languages.</p>
<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
<p>The purpose of OOP is to isolate each object from each other. This is in contrast with the traditional <b>procedural</b> paradigm where attributes and functions are mixed with other code. Thus the benefit of using OOP is to keep everything nice and tidy so that we can treat each object as a black box. We just need to care about what interface of an object, namely what methods can be called on that object and what attributes it contains. This is call encapsulation. Encapsulation sticks things together if they are from the same object and separate objects apart from each other.</p>
