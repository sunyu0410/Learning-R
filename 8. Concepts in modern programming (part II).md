<h1>Concepts in modern programming (part II)</h1>
<h2>Object-oriented programming</h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is an alternative way of formulating and solving a computer problem. It treats entities in programs as objects, objects in real life. This programming paradigm  is supported by most modern languages, including R.</p>

<h2>Class</h2>
<p>The concept of objects is hand in hand with the concept of classes. A class is a blue print of an object. An object, on the other hand, is an instatiation of a class. You can define a class (blue print) once and use it to make multiple objects (say, build more than one house).</p>

<h2>Attribute and behavior</h2>
<p>Most objects in real life has associated data attached to them. For a bank account, it has an account name, an account number, a valid period and its balance. For a book, it has a title, an author, its price and word counts. These data, or attributes, are some information we really care in problem solving. You can think attributes as object-owned variables.</p>
<p>Similarly, most objects also have behaviors. A person can walk and speak, a vehicle can move, a gun can fire, etc. Behaviors performs some tasks and they are actually functions, object-associated functions.</p>

<h2>What's special about OOP?</h2>
<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<p>The process to extract a "class" requires certain types of abstraction. Sometimes the level of such abstraction could be very high, especially when the class itself is not touchable, e.g. relationships between the boss and employees.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>Sometimes, one class can fall into the category of another class. For example, we have a class named <code>human</code> which has some attributes (name, gender, age) and behaviours (eat, sleep, walk). Say we have another class <code>teacher</code>. Assuming all teachers are humans, we should expect the <code>teacher</code> class should have at least the minimal attributes and behaviours from the <code>human</code> class. Instead of defining the <code>teacher</code> class from ground up, <code>teacher</code> can <b>inherit</b> from <code>human</code>. This means <code>teacher</code> is constructed on the basis of <code>human</code>. Further customisations can be made on <code>teacher</code>. But borrowing all attributes and methods from <code>human</code> saves lots of work and add to clarity. In this case, we say <code>teacher</code> is a <b>subclass</b> of <code>human</code> and <code>human</code> is the <b>superclass</b> of <code>teacher</code>. In some languages, multiple inheritance is allowed, meaning a class can borrow from more than one other class.
<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
<p>The purpose of OOP is to isolate each object from each other. This is in contrast with the traditional <b>procedural</b> paradigm where attributes and functions are mixed with other logics. The benefit of using OOP is to keep everything nice and tidy so that we can treat each object as a stand-alone unit. We just need to care about the specific unit everytime we deal with them, namely what methods can be called on that object and what attributes it contains. This is called encapsulation. Encapsulation sticks things together if they are from the same object and separate objects apart from each other.</p>
